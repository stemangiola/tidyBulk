\S4method{reduce_dimensions}{tbl_df}(
  .data,
  .element = NULL,
  .feature = NULL,
  .abundance = NULL,
  method,
  .dims = 2,
  top = 500,

}
\arguments{
\item{.data}{A `tbl` formatted as | <SAMPLE> | <TRANSCRIPT> | <COUNT> | <...> |}

\item{.element}{The name of the element column (normally samples).}

\item{.feature}{The name of the feature column (normally transcripts/genes)}

\item{.abundance}{The name of the column including the numerical value the clustering is based on (normally transcript abundance)}

\item{method}{A character string. The dimension reduction algorithm to use (PCA, MDS, tSNE).}

\item{.dims}{A list of integer vectors corresponding to principal components of interest (e.g., list(1:2, 3:4, 5:6))}

\item{top}{An integer. How many top genes to select for dimensionality reduction}

\item{of_samples}{A boolean. In case the input is a ttBulk object, it indicates Whether the element column will be sample or transcript column}

\item{log_transform}{A boolean, whether the value should be log-transformed (e.g., TRUE for RNA sequencing data)}

\item{scale}{A boolean for method="PCA", this will be passed to the `prcomp` function. It is not included in the ... argument because although the default for `prcomp` if FALSE, it is advisable to set it as TRUE.}

\item{action}{A character string. Whether to join the new information to the input tbl (add), or just get the non-redundant tbl with the new information (get).}

\item{...}{Further parameters passed to the function prcomp if you choose method="PCA" or Rtsne if you choose method="tSNE"}
}
\value{
A tbl object with additional columns for the reduced dimensions
